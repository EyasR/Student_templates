🌐 How to Put This Website Online (GitHub Pages)

This project is a website made with:

index.html (the website)

style.css (the design)

script.js (the code/logic)

We can host it online for FREE using GitHub Pages.

✅ Step 1: Upload your files to GitHub

Go to GitHub.com

Click New Repository

Name it something like: my-website

Click Create Repository

Upload your project files:

index.html

style.css

script.js

✅ IMPORTANT: Your main file must be called index.html

✅ Step 2: Turn on GitHub Pages

Go to your GitHub repository

Click Settings

On the left side, click Pages

Under Source, choose:

Deploy from a branch

Under Branch, choose:

main

/root

Click Save

✅ Step 3: Get your website link

After you save it, GitHub will give you a website link like this:

https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/


⏳ It might take 1–2 minutes to work the first time.

✅ Step 4: Update your website later

Whenever you change your code and upload it to GitHub again,
your website updates automatically ✅

Just refresh the page.

🧠 If something doesn’t work…

✅ Make sure your file is named exactly:

index.html

style.css

script.js

⚠️ GitHub is picky about spelling and capital letters
(example: Style.css is NOT the same as style.css)

🎉 Done!

Your project is now online and shareable 😄✅
