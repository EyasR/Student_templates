# 🌐 How to Put This Website Online (GitHub Pages)

This project is a website made with:

- `index.html` (the website)
- `style.css` (the design)
- `script.js` (the code/logic)

We can host it online for FREE using **GitHub Pages**.

## ✅ Step 3: Get your website link

After you save it, GitHub will give you a website link like this:

`https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/`

⏳ It might take **1–2 minutes** to work the first time.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Update your website later

Whenever you change your code and upload it to GitHub again,  
your website updates automatically ✅

Just refresh the page.

## 🧠 If something doesn’t work...

Make sure your file names are exactly:

- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `script.js`

⚠️ GitHub is picky about spelling and capital letters.  
Example: `Style.css` is NOT the same as `style.css`

## 🎉 Done!

Your project is now online and shareable 😄✅
